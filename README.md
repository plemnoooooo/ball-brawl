## IN DEVELOPMENT

![game preview](/.github/README/preview.png)

A multiplayer game is about throwing and collecting the most number of balls.

## How to play

The game's objective is to get the most number of balls in two minutes. The player who has the most balls at the end of the game wins.

One way that the player can win, other than collecting more balls, is to use their balls and throw them at their opponents, which can be used to deflect and knock balls off them.

## Controls

To move, use WASD on your keyboard or press and hold anywhere on the screen.

To throw a ball, aim the ball with your mouse or finger snd either use the spacebar on your keyboard or press the gray button at the bottom of the screen.
